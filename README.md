# Node.js-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

This is the 'Module 09' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

Based on the starter code we were given, we were tasked with creating a README generator. This project helps to build experience with working in the terminal and utilizing command line functions via Javascript.

## Installation

1. Git clone into VSCode
2. Right click 'index.js' file and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'
3. Run 'npm init -y'
4. Run 'npm i inquirer'

## Usage

In the terminal, run 'node index.js' and fill out all the questions. Doing so will create your desired README.
